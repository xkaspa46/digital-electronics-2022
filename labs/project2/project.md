## Project objectives

Applicaton of modules was set in this order:
- **PWM initialization**
- **Wiping servo motor**

## Brief hardware of description Servo motor and schematic

This section is reserved for a short description of an element our project is composed of. It also includes wiring scheme.

### Servo motor

* Servo motor, unlike conventional motor is capable of setting the rotation at exact position. Even tho the servo is allowing us to be more accurate, it is also capable of a small rotation speed.
* In our application we use PWM (Phase-Width Modulation) in order to control the end positions.

*We can see a look of a 5V servomotor below:*

## Wiper drive
* In general
  * In our application we consider a servo motor as a driver for a windshield wiper similar to those used in real cars.
  * Nowadays wipers use DC motors with permanent magnets and two push-buttons on end positions to oscilate between these two borders.
  * Considering the servo motor is capable of high accuracy, the push-buttons might not be no longer needed.

* Controll
  * If we decide to push the button, the motors start to oscilate between two borders at a certain angle corresponding to real car windshield (about 110Â°).
  * Second push of the button will then increse the speed by two.
  * Third one will turn off the wipers completely and they will automatically return to a starting position.
  * The whole cycle may start again.
