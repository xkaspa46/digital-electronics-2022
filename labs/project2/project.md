## Project objectives

Applicaton of modules was set in this order:
- **PWM initialization**
- **Wiping servo motor**


<a name="hardware"></a>

## Brief hardware of description Servo motor and schematic

This section is reserved for a short description of each element our project is composed of. It also includes separated wiring schemes corresponding to each one of used hardware for better orientation.

<a name="arduinoHW"></a>

### Servo motor

It is a development board consisting of ATmega328 microcontroller, 14 digital GPIO pins (6 PWM), 6 analog input pins, 16 MHz crystal oscilator, built-in pre-defined UART etc. Programmed via USB 2.0, it has 32 kB flash memory (0.5 kB for bootloader). 

*We can see a look of the board below:*

## Software and libraries

   | **Library name** | **Brief description** | **Usage in our code** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | GPIO  | Allowing high performance digital pin access | Setting Input/Output of a pin and reading its values |
   | Timer | Hardware block within an MCU and can be used to measure time events | Determination of refresh time of display and code cycle, interrupt `sei()` |
   | AVR   | Predefined library of AVR microcontrollers | Basic functions for working with registers |

### Software flowcharts

* *Note: Flowcharts 2-4 are all part of a one function but -again- are separated for better orientation*
* *Also for all applications, we use TIM1_overflow_33ms()*

## Functions

<a name="joystick"></a>

### Joystick

<a name="positionmap"></a>

* **Position map**
  * First of our described functions is situated on the very left side of the display where it shows us via **x:___** and **y:___** corresponding coordinates on an imaginary map. These coordinates are naturally equal to the value meassured by analog inputs **A0** and **A1**. Meassured value can only be from a scale from 0 to 1024. 
  * Both rising/falling values have an intuitive working mechanism. With a certain inaccuracy in real implemantation - a starting value on *x* and *y* is 511 as shown in a simulation. Moving the joystick to the right, we are incrementing an **x** value. Naturally its decreasing turning the joystick left. Analogically, the **y** value changes with up/down direction.

*Simulation of a function in SimulIDE:*

<a name="buttondetect"></a>
* **Button detection**
  * Next to the left side of the BUT logo, we have our second function associated with the joystick. This time, it has to be pushed down in order to detect a voltage change. Once detected, the controller is told to change the current state of a segment to the second one (either 0 or 1).

<a name="encoder"></a>

### Encoder

<a name="counter"></a>

* **Value counter up/down**
  * Function is explained within its own name. 
  * Rotating the encoder clockwise will always count +1 to the current value. Counter clockwise rotation decreases the value by -1.
  * The range of values is not limited and therefor the value can be even negative *(shown in YT video)*

<a name="alphabet"></a>

* **Alphabet**
  * If we decide to push the endocer, we push a button and enter uncover another function of out project.
  * Each push makes an increment of a current value by +1 which not only shows the count but also the english alphabet above.
  * When reached the maximum of 24 letters and button pushed once more, the sequence resets and is ready to continue.
